I come from Kerala, a land of backwaters, coconut palms, green mountains and Ayurveda,  all of which I took for granted growing up.

I began my career in software engineering after graduating in Computer Science with my last role at Symbian/Nokia, before transitioning to academia to pursue research in Cognitive Neuroscience. My interest in Neuroscience began from reading books during my commute, a curiosity that ultimately became one of the most enjoyable and inspiring decisions of my life.

After completing my PhD, I found my way into data science. The opportunities that machine learning presents, especially in combination with medical research continue to fascinate me. My long-term goal is to work at the intersection of a meaningful domain, ideally Neuroscience, applying machine learning and emerging developments in AI to solve real problems.

This site features a curated list of my publications and useful external resources in areas of my interests.
